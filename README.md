# CCCB Doorbell System

Shitty pile of code for the Arduino in the Bread Box for controlling the door opener.

## Thursday Mode
When the mode is enabled, the door will be opened after the first click on the Door Bell
It will be disabled with a timeout, so you can't forget to turn it off.

## Code Opener
When the Door Bell ist pressed 3 Times in a Row, the door will open.
